Ever get in an argument and try to google something but didn't have much signal?



SMS Service whose purpose is to retrieve and text back wikipedia summary of the article you texted in. As I worked on this, I found out that wikipedia doesn't have a api call to get a clean formatted text. 
Therefore to create a working prototype, I just used wikipedia-js (installed using npm) to get an html formatted text. The Challenge I'm currently running through is getting a clean formatted text from wikipedia.
Right now it's borderline unreadable with all the HTML formatting. People made regex for wikipedia parsing, but it was in python/java which I didn't know how to utilize :(
